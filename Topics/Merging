Merging:
Merging happens once you have done the following things.
  1) Created a branch
  2) Made your changes
  3) Submitted a pull request
  
Merging allows the owner of the project to include your changes into it.

Merging compares the selected branches and updates the main branch from the one that has the changes included.
