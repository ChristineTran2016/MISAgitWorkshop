Commit:
A commit is the most basic form of submitting your changes.

Once you have made a few changes you can commit them.

A commit can be as big or small as you'd like.

Good practice is to commit often so you can restore your changes and track your incrimental changes.

Commits can be named to help identify what has been added.
